## Motivation

A framework enables developer to write managable code and makes it easy for them to manage the code. But problem is that most frameworks are bloated. They have the features you don't require. That makes not suitable for small projects and causes fall in performance. 

For Example
*  You require only Router and Database for API. You can use LightFramework and install only Routing and Database plugins. No bloatware of email library, hashing libraries etc.

* You want a static website. You can use Router only.

* You want a website with dynamic content, You can use Router and Template Engine.

## Features
    * Easy
    * Very minimum code for initialization.
    * Deferred calls
    * Call deffered calls prematurely when required.
    * Add callables as plugin


## Installtion
Install via Composer

```
composer require nabeelalihashmi/LightFramework
```

Or Download the class and use own autoloading function.


## Usage

* Create new instance of LightFramework
It requires 4 arguments
  - `config`: Path of directory where configuration files are stored.
  - `autoload` : Path of directory where files for autoloading are stored.
  - `global_symbol` : The symbol from which instance of LightFramework will be asscessable globally. Default is `__`

Example:
```
$light = new LightFramework('config', 'autoload', '__');

```
* Plugin the modules. with `plugModule()` method. It requires 3 arguments
- `key`: The name of the plugin module which will accessed later using `$light->getModule($key)`
- `callable`: the callable plugin
- `callback`: the callback called by framework when object is loaded.

Example:
```
$demo = new Demo(10, 20);
$light->pluginModule('demo', $demo, function($demo) {
  $demo->showMessage();
});

```

* Initiate the Framework
```
$light->init();
```

## NOTE
When `init` is called, first autoload libs in autoload direcotry all loaded. After that plugin in autoload_module.config.php file are loaded.
